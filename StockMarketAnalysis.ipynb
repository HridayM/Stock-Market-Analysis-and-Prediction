By looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks and others. Used pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. Predicted future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!\n",

This means that the stock price follows a random walk and is consistent with (at the very least) the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH): past price information is already incorporated and the next price movement is \"conditionally independent\" of past price movements.\n",
        "# \n",
        "# This means that the past information on the price of a stock is independent of where the stock price will be in the future, basically meaning, you can't perfectly predict the future solely based on the previous price of a stock.\n",
        "# \n",
        "\n",
        "# Now we see that the change in the stock price is the current stock price multiplied by two terms. The first term is known as \"drift\", which is the average daily return multiplied by the change of time. The second term is known as \"shock\", for each time period the stock will \"drift\" and then experience a \"shock\" which will randomly push the stock price up or down. By simulating this series of steps of drift and shock thousands of times, we can begin to do a simulation of where we might expect the stock price to be.\n",
